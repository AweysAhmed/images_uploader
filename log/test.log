Error: Missing binding /Users/aweysahmed/Documents/projects/image_uploader_app/node_modules/node-sass/vendor/darwin-x64-64/binding.node
Node Sass could not find a binding for your current environment: OS X 64-bit with Node.js 10.x

Found bindings for the following environments:
  - OS X 64-bit with Node.js 12.x

This usually happens because your environment has changed since running `npm install`.
Run `npm rebuild node-sass` to download the binding for your current environment.
